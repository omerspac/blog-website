        The forgotten temple city of Bagan in Myanmar is like a bizarre fairytale, with a landscape of mysterious and exotic pagodas that goes beyond just culture shock.
        <br /><br />
        I felt like time travelers stepping into the ancient ruins of the Bagan Myanmar temples. In ages past, there were more than 10,000 shrines and monasteries here, and the Burma temples still standing are completely fascinating to explore and photograph.
        <br /><br />
        Old Bagan was once known as Pagan. At that time, it was a religious city and capital of the rich Pagan empire, and more than 10,000 Buddhist monasteries, stupas, and small temples were built there over the course of 250 years.

        So is Bagan Myanmar a safe place to travel? Generally, yes. There are a few small, isolated areas in Myanmar with occasional violence and instability, but these hotspots are far from Bagan, and tourists are not the target.
        <br /><br />
        The best time to visit Bagan is October - February. There is best weather in these months, with cooler temps (under 80 Â°F). These are the most popular months for tourists, especially in December and January.
